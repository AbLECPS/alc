# Misc Thoughts
+ Should I create this yaml stuff by hand?
    + For now, I think it is a good idea - I can't get things like default values programmatically
    + In the future, it should be an alternative representation for the meta sheet
        + May need to rethink the syntax a little... Currently, it mixes inheritance and attributes...
            + A node with attributes cannot be subclassed
