# External Definitions

The `External Definitions` folder allows the declaration of external `Ros Packages`. This allows any software component to interact with an external package via its predefined `messages` and `services`.

## Documentation Style Guide

For an External Definition documentation block, use the following headers in order to generate consistent and flowing documentation.

```no-highlight
# External Definitions
## Package List
(for each)### Available Messages and Services
