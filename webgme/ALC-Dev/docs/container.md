# Container

This is a container, a representation of a host/hardware that will exist and be used when running an experiment. Create a node for each separate process that will run inside this container. Note, multiple hardware components can be instantiated and run inside of a single host.

## Documentation Style Guide

For a container-level documentation block use the following headers in order to generate consistent and flowing documentation.

```no-highlight
# [Container Name]
## Intended Hardware/Host Type
## System Role

```
