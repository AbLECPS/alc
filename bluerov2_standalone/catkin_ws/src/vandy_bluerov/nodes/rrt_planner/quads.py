"""
A pure Python Quadtree implementation.
Quadtrees are a useful data structure for sparse datasets where the
location/position of the data is important. They're especially good for
spatial indexing & image processing.
Usage::
    >>> import quads
    >>> tree = quads.QuadTree(
    ...     (0, 0),  # The center point
    ...     10,  # The width
    ...     10,  # The height
    ... )
    # You can choose to simply represent points that exist.
    >>> tree.insert((1, 2))
    True
    # ...or include extra data at those points.
    >>> tree.insert(quads.Point(4, -3, data="Samus"))
    True
    # You can search for a given point. It returns the point if found...
    >>> tree.find((1, 2))
    Point(1, 2)
    # Or `None` if there's no match.
    >>> tree.find((4, -4))
    None
    # You can also find all the points within a given region.
    >>> bb = quads.BoundingBox(min_x=-1, min_y=-2, max_x=2, max_y=2)
    >>> tree.within_bb(bb)
    [Point(1, 2)]
    # You can also search to find the nearest neighbors of a point, even
    # if that point doesn't have data within the quadtree.
    >>> tree.nearest_neighbors((0, 1), count=2)
    [
        Point(1, 2),
        Point(4, -4),
    ]
    # And if you have `matplotlib` installed (not required!), you can
    # visualize the tree.
